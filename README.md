This is the source repository for ByteFF-Pol.

* [ByteFF-Pol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575) is a polarizable force field parameterized by a graph neural network (GNN), trained on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data, thus eliminating the need for experimental calibration. ByteFF-Pol achieves exceptional accuracy in predicting the thermodynamic and transport properties of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming SOTA traditional and ML force fields.

## News
[2025/08/25]🔥We release ByteFF-Pol.


## Getting started
### Prerequisites
* Python version >= 3.11

### Python Dependencies
All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. To install them, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Installing Packmol
Packmol builds the initial liquid box. The simplest route is conda:
```
conda install -c conda-forge packmol
```

Or build it from source (see the [Packmol site](https://m3g.github.io/packmol)):
```
git clone https://github.com/m3g/packmol.git
cd packmol
make
```

ByteFF2 looks for the executable in this order: `$PACKMOL_BIN`, then `packmol` on
your `$PATH`. If it lives somewhere unusual, point at it directly:
```
export PACKMOL_BIN=/path/to/packmol
```

> Gromacs is no longer required. Earlier versions used `gmx editconf` and
> `gmx insert-molecules` to pack the box; Packmol now does that job. ByteFF2
> still reads and writes Gromacs `.top`/`.itp`/`.gro` **files** (that is how
> OpenMM ingests the force field), but the `gmx` binary is never invoked.

### Installing OpenMM for ByteFF2

To run **ByteFF2**, you need a customized version of [**OpenMM**](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) and [**OpenMM-VelocityVerlet**](https://github.com/z-gong/openmm-velocityVerlet).

1. Navigate to the `submodules/openmm` directory:
   ```bash
   cd submodules/openmm
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh [OPENMM_DIR]
   ```
   - `[OPENMM_DIR]` (optional): Installation path for OpenMM.
   - Default installation path is:
     ```
     /usr/local/openmm
     ```

3. The script will:
   - Compile and install the patched `openmm` (v8.3.1)
   - Compile and install `openmm-velocityVerlet`
   - Add required environment variables (`OPENMM_DIR` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) to your `~/.bashrc`

4. After installation, restart your terminal or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

After successful installation, you should see:
```
Success: Installed OpenMM and openmm-velocityVerlet.
```

### Trained Models
The model and configuration file are available on HuggingFace [byteff2](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance-Seed/byteff2).

To download the model and configuration file, run:
```
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
hf download ByteDance-Seed/byteff2 --local-dir byteff2
```

## Quick Start
You can refer to several examples in the · directory; more details are available in the README.md file for each example.

* `example/1_training` contains scripts for training ByteFF-Pol.
* `example/2_compare_qm` contains scripts to compare QM and FF energies.
* `example/3_write_params` contains scripts to generate force field parameters using trained ByteFF-Pol model.
* `example/4_MD_simulations` contains scripts for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using ByteFF-Pol.
* `example/5_similarity` contains scripts for similarity analysis using ByteFF-Pol.

## Run Tests
You can verify the environments by running the tests:
```
make test
```
